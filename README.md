[Vitruv](https://vitruv.tools) is a framework for view-based software development. It assumes different models to be used for describing a software system,
which are automatically kept consistent by the framework and its applications. For general information on Vitruv, see our [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/vitruv-tools) and our [Wiki](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/.github/wiki).

This project contains the central definition of a V-SUM (Virtual Single Underlying Model) containing development artifacts to be kept consistent and to be accessed and modified via views.

## Installation

Vitruv can be installed in Eclipse via the [nightly update site](https://vitruv.tools/updatesite/nightly). A wiki page provides [detailed instructions for using or extending Vitruv](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/.github/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Project Development

Vitruv is realized as Eclipse Plug-ins and depends on the following Eclipse tools:
- Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) _as the modelling environment_
- Xtend _for code_
